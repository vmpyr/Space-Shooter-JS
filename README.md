# Space-Shooter-JS
A simple shoot-em-up game in JS.

The game utilizes the Canvas 2D API.

It includes scores, pause menu, welcome screen, game-over screen, and highscore keeping.
Some basic but good-looking animations have also been incorporated.

I do not own any of the images.
The owner of the PNG assets is Kenney Vleugels of Kenney.nl (the license has been includes along with the assets)
